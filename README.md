# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristian!
I'm a very casual self-learned coder, dabbling primarily in Swift and the odd Arduino/Python project. 

I always look to learn new things, and I'm open to take input on how my pull requests can be better (or made into working shape at all).

My day job is very much non-technical, so every now and then it's nice to dive into the FOSS communities to learn and (every now and again) hopefully contribute some as well.
